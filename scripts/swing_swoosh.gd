extends Node2D
## Overhead melee swing effect: the equipped weapon sweeping top-to-forward
## around the shoulder, plus a crescent swoosh arc with trailing follow-through
## lines. (Between swings the player carries the weapon on their back — that
## sprite lives in player.gd and hides while this one plays.)
## Fades out over the swing and frees itself. Added as a child of the
## player, so it inherits body scale and moves with them; set `facing` and
## `weapon` before add_child.

## START_ANGLE while the player charges, with no arc drawn (there is no sweep
## to trail yet). release() lets go, and the swing plays from the top exactly
## as an uncharged one does — the sweep is never a different animation.

## bonus (the tint only arrives at Player.CHARGE_TIME). Deliberately tiny —

## is radians either side of the raised pose; set it to 0.0 to remove the
## effect without touching anything else.
