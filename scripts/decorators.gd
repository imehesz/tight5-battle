class_name Decorators
extends RefCounted
## The chest decorations the player can wear — a flag, a logo, a gold star —
## pinned to the shirt (or the dress) wherever their comedian is drawn.
## Purely cosmetic: nothing here touches damage, speed or score.
##
## The catalog is ONE shared list every edition wears — shared/assets/
## decorators/decorators.json, right next to the art it lists — plus an
## optional games/<id>/decorators.json for a city's own extras. Data, like
## characters.json and weapons.json, not code: adding one is a PNG in that
## folder and a row in that file. Nothing in the game hardcodes a decoration.
##
## Unlike weapons, a city file ADDS to the shared list rather than replacing it.
## A city row whose id is new leads the shelf; one whose id is already shared
## overlays that row field by field, so `{"id": "palm-tree", "enabled": false}`
## benches one shared decoration in one edition without copying the rest.
##
## NB the manifest key is "decorators", NOT "decor" — that one is already taken
## by the street's ambient dressing (see StreetDecor).
##
## Per-row fields (see decorators.json):
##   id       permanent identity. Saves and purchases key on this, so a row can
##            be renamed or re-priced without anyone losing what they bought.
##   category display grouping ONLY — the picker heads a block with it and
##            nothing else ever reads it.
##   name     what the card is labelled.
##   path     PNG relative to the JSON it is written in (or "shared/..." / a
##            full res:// path).
##   price    JOKE POINTS. 0 means wear it straight away; anything higher has
##            to be bought once, and the SERVER charges it (see /decor).
##   enabled  false benches the row: dropped entirely, like a disabled venue.
##            A benched pick falls back to nothing, so no save is ever broken.
##   scale    optional per-item size multiplier on CHEST_BASE_PX, for art whose
##            subject doesn't fill its canvas. Defaults to 1.0.

## "wearing nothing", the value a save holds for a player who has never picked.
const NONE := -1

## How wide a decoration is drawn on the body, in body-local pixels, before a
## row's own `scale`. Art of any canvas size is normalized to it, exactly like
## heads are normalized to Fighter.HEAD_BASE_PX — so this one number is the
## size knob for the whole shelf.
##
## Measured against both body sheets rather than guessed. Standing, the shirt
## runs neck+3 to neck+18 (the male sheet; the female dress carries on to
## neck+23), and below the shoulders the torso is 12px across, x -6..5. A 10px
## square centred on CHEST_POS therefore lands inside the shirt on every frame
## of every animation, with a pixel of margin either side.
const CHEST_BASE_PX := 10.0

## Where the decoration sits, relative to the animation's NECK anchor
## (CharacterFactory.HEAD_OFFSETS) — the same trick the chest strap uses, so it
## rides the walk bob, the punch lean and the hit recoil with no per-frame
## tuning. x mirrors with facing.
const CHEST_POS := Vector2(0, 10)

## Ducking squashes the torso to roughly half its standing height — the shirt
## ends at neck+12 instead of neck+18 — so the decoration needs its own shorter
## anchor and a size to match, or it would spill off onto the knees.
