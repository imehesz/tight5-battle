class_name Weapons
extends RefCounted
## The melee weapons a fighter can carry. Purely cosmetic: every weapon swings
## with the mic stand's damage, reach and cooldown (see Battler.SWING_*), so a
## fight is never won by picking the chainsaw. No upgrades in this game.
##
## The roster lives in shared/assets/weapons/weapons.json, right next to the
## art it lists — data, like characters.json and venues.json, not code. Adding
## one is a two-step job: drop a PNG in shared/assets/weapons/ and add a row to
## that file. Nothing else in the game hardcodes a weapon. A game can also ship
## its own games/<id>/weapons.json to replace the shared rack (see games/README.md).
##
## Every sprite shares the mic stand's canvas (302x900, art within y 22..872,
## striking end up, centred), which is what lets the swing and carry code size
## them all from the same constants — helper-tools/normalize_weapon.py puts
## generated art onto that canvas. Both guitars are swung by the NECK, so their
## art is turned end-for-end on the way in (normalize_weapon.py --rotate180) to
## put the body up at the striking end.
##
## Per-row fields (see weapons.json):
##
## `GripY` is the texture-space y the player's hand closes on. It is the one
## number that genuinely differs per weapon: a sword is held just under the
## crossguard, a bat down by the knob. Swing code scales grip-to-tip to a fixed
## on-screen length, so this also decides how much weapon hangs past the fist.
##
## `GripUp` flips the weapon end-for-end on the player's BACK only (never
## during the swing): slung handle-up over the shoulder, business end pointing
## down at the hip — which is how you would actually wear a sword or a shovel,
## and how you'd have to wear one to be able to draw it. The two that hang the
## other way are the ones a person really does carry pointy-end-up: the mic
## stand, whose head is its whole silhouette, and the chain, which has no
## business end at all. (The guitars are worn neck-up, like a gig bag.)

## The shared rack every game gets unless it ships its own weapons.json.
const SHARED_ROSTER := "res://shared/assets/weapons/weapons.json"

## The mic stand — what a player who has never opened the weapons tab carries,
## and the fallback whenever a saved pick can't be honoured. (The first row of
## weapons.json; keep the mic stand there.)

## Parse the roster. GameState calls this at boot with the active game's
## games/<id>/weapons.json path; when that file doesn't exist (the usual case)
## the shared rack loads instead. Rows with `"isDisabled": true` are benched:
## dropped entirely, like disabled venues — saves store the weapon by id, so a
## benched pick just falls back to the mic stand and no data is lost.
